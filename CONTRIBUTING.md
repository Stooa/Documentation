# How to contribute

Stooa is the Open Source unconference project, and we are really happy to recieve contributions ðŸŽ‰. There are many different ways to contribute to Stooaâ€™s development, just find the one that best fits with your skills or concerns, not all of them require coding skills or opening pull requests.

## Contribute to the codebase 

To contribute to Stooa's codebase you should fork the project, make your changes locally and then creating a pull request. If you don't know how to do this process properly don't worry, check this quick tutorials about [forking][how_to_fork] and [pull requests][how_to_pr]. (Everyone has been there at some point ðŸ˜Š )

If it is **the first time** you contribute to Stooa's codebase you will be asked to sign the [DCO License](CONTRIBUTING.md#dco-license), which is basically that you ensure that code is yours, that you are aware of the license we are using, etc...

### Pull requests 

To contribute to the project you have to firstly carefully read the [**DCO**](CONTRIBUTING.md#DCO-license) section, use the pull request system and format your commits accordingly.

If you intend to [fix a bug](CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an [issue][issue_bug] detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

Please, when creating a new **pull request** read our template carefully and don't delete it (it will appear when you start a pull request). This will help you to provide all the information needed to understand your contribution, not only to the core team, but also for other contributors.

If you want to implement or start working in a **new feature**, please open a **question** / **discussion** issue for it. No **pull request** will be accepted without previous chat about the changes, independently if it is a new feature, already planned feature or small quick win.
