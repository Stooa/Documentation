### [Bug Report](how-to-contribute.md#bug-report)

We use github issues to report new bugs either internals or externals, this way we ensure the issues having a linked PR and visibility near the code. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

If you found a bug, please report it, as far as possible including:

* a detailed explanation of steps to reproduce the error.
* a browser and the browser version used.
* a dev tools console exception stack trace (if it is available).

If you find a security bug, that you would prefer to discuss in private, you can first mail us at stooa@stooa.com.

### [Bug Fixing](how-to-contribute.md#bug-fixing)

You can explore our Github's issues to find bugs. They are classified and explained by the community or the core team.

To fix them just create a PR linking the issue, [you can do it this way](how-to-contribute.md).

### [Documentation](how-to-contribute.md#documentation)

If you find some errors, or want to improve documentation you can do it in [this repository](https://github.com/Stooa/Documentation) by forking it and creating a PR.

If you've never done this, here is a step by step guide.
